        <p>
            Growing up I had everything I wanted but a stable family connection. Not everyone goes through tough family situations growing up, however, the ones who do can understand the type of a person it can make you in the long run. I've learned to accept that life isn't always on your side and you just have to survive to the next day to progress any further towards your dream(s). Once I started working and making money it opened my eyes to the real world and showed me what it's like to be there for myself and develop self-love for myself even if nobody else is there with me, which I consider a major success. Fortunately, now I have many friends and support systems that motivate me to get out of bed every day to do what has to be done. Over the course of my education, I've managed to accomplish honor roll three times throughout middle school and high school. It doesn't sound too much like a huge success, but rather for me it was a great feeling that proved my effort was paying off. As much as I despise doing homework and taking tests, the school has set me on an amazing path with friends and education toward my future. My most proud and beneficial accomplishment of mine is overcoming my anxiety about going to a therapist to situate the many problems I had built up in my head over the years. It isn't hard for me to admit this now that I see the difference it makes to talk to someone if you genuinely need help but can't find the strength to accept it. I waited many years, but it's never too late to overcome fear if you're willing to get the help you need without depending on other people to do it for you.
